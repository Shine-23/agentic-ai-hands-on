# DevProject AI

An AI-powered engineering planning assistant that converts rough product requirements into task breakdowns, architecture notes, API drafts, and implementation plans.

---

## Problem
Developers often start with a product idea but lack a structured engineering plan to implement it. The gap between "I have an idea" and "I know what to build first" slows teams down and leads to poor architectural decisions made under pressure.

DevProject AI fills that gap — acting as a senior engineering collaborator that thinks through scope, architecture, and risk before a single line of code is written.

## Users

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Requirement analysis | Extracts goals, users, features, and constraints from raw input |
| Scope definition | Separates MVP from future enhancements |
| Architecture planning | Proposes a stack-aware high-level architecture |
| API contract drafting | Drafts endpoints with methods, payloads, and auth rules |
| Task decomposition | Breaks work into milestones, tasks, and subtasks |
| Risk review | Surfaces ambiguity, unknowns, and integration risks |
| Implementation sequencing | Recommends practical build order |
| Development tickets | Generates structured tickets with acceptance criteria and story points |
| Plan history | Saves, loads, and deletes plans with their tickets |

---

## MCP Tools
Three tools enrich the AI plan with real project context:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `repo_tool` | Scans a local directory or clones a public GitHub repo |
| `docs_tool` | Fetches documentation from a URL or local file |
| `shell_tool` | Runs shell commands and captures output (e.g. `pip list`) |

All three tools feed their output into Claude before the plan is generated. If any tool fails the request returns a `400` error immediately — context is never silently skipped.
